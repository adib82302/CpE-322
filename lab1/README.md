This lab goes over ghdl installation and GTKwave installation on my macbook bro. 

I installed ghdl and gtkwave following the instructions on my Professors github. 
  This required me to access my terminal and input the corresponding commands to install these packages. I used homebrew to install some packages and PERL   for Switch to use on GTKwave
  
The next step was to run three vhdl files using the ghdl command in my terminal
