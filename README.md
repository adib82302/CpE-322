# CPE 322

This is a 6th semester design course that prepares students for Senior Design. 

It goes over all of the processes that one should consider during a design process such as:  

- Needs Assessment  
- Structuring the Search for the Problem  
- Structuring the Search for a Solution  
- Acquiring, Applying, and Protecting Technical Knowledge  
- Abstraction and Modeling  
- Synthesis  
- Ethics and Product Liability  
- Hazards Analysis and Failure Analysis  
- Design Analysis  
- Implementation  

The course also has weekly labs that introduce new technologies, software, and concepts that one can use during their design process.  

The folders in this repository have these weekly labs as well as images showcasing my results. 

The files that I run are credited to Professor Lu and is from his github profile.
